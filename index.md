## Welcome to the JxYML API page

The JxYML API is a simple way to save and load data. This project is ***open-source*** so everyone can collaborate.

The API is still under developing and the lastest version is [pre-v.0.2](https://github.com/IamPekka058/JxYML/releases/tag/pre-v.0.2).

### Installation

To use the API you have to include the jar in your project.
